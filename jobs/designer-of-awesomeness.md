* Interact with clients and product owners

## Description of the job

We’re looking for a super special designer to join our team, and work alongside Rails developers, front end developers, producers and content people.

Here’s why you need to be super special: Any designer can create something in isolation, but you need to be able to use your solid understanding of design for the web, information architecture and user experience to create alongside clients and teams in a dynamic environment. We also want you to have a basic understanding of Javascript MVC frameworks (like AngularJS), with a view to expanding your skillset in this area. You can read [more on our blawg.](/pjax/asynchronous-javascript-frameworks-like-angular-js/ "more on our blawg.")

We’re after a serious designophile. Someone who gives a damn and believes functionality can exist side-by-side with amazing user experience in state of digital nirvana. We approach projects from a “mobile first” perspective. This means that we serve our sites across multiple devices, but the user experience has to maintain its look and feel, functionality, and intuitiveness. Everything changes, but the user feels comfortable and grounded no matter what they are viewing the site on.

Ideally you will be passionate about:

* awesome design and great user experience
* solving problems that people didn’t even know exist
* the responsive web. You have a good understanding of HTML, CSS, and a basic working knowledge of javascript
* people
* working as part of a close team of designers in an Agile context
