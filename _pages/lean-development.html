          <p>In a nutshell, Lean Development is about eliminating waste, maximising learnings, empowering the team and building integrity into projects. Lean development and the agile methodology go hand in hand in a lot of ways. For example, lean development acknowledges that uncertainty is a natural part of development, and the agile framework allows for constant adjustments as events unfold and circumstances change. Perfect.</p>
