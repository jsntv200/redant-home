title: Cyber security from a development perspective
description: We look at Cyber Security from a Development perspective. Many security teams will start with infrastructure and networks. Probing to see how a bad actor can get in to your platform. Our take is a bit different. We think youâ€™re just as likely to be exposed by poor software - either in how it was built or is being maintained.

<p class="subheading-small">
  Often security analysis looks at networks and infrastructure - the things your platform runs on. And while this is definitely important, often problems can lie within the software itself. Or how that software connects with other software or data points. How it's built, configured and maintained.

<p class="subheading-small">
  That's where we can help.

  Keeping software secure is somewhat of a moving target. There isn't a magic wand we can wave to somehow make it "secure". It requires a unique development mindset.
