    Here are some of the key things our strategy team will look at when
    approaching a new project:
  </h5>

  <ul class="list-disc mb-10 pl-5">
    <li>
      Detailed knowledge of your company and how the different areas and
      departments work.
    </li>
    <li>
      In depth understanding of your target markets and how they wish to engage
      online – resulting in knowing what will work and what won’t work online.
    </li>
    <li>
      Recommendations on suppliers – we’ve worked extensively with suppliers and
      other partner agencies for SEO, sample fulfilment, hosting and more.
    </li>
    <li>
      Mobile First approach.
    </li>
    <li>
      Constant tracking that allows us to improve and adjust strategies moving
      forward.
    </li>
  </ul>
