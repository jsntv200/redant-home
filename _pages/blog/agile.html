  <div class="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-3 gap-10">
    <p>
      <b>Roadmapping</b> - to map out features, goals and timeframes for projects.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Standup</b> - if these don't happen, the project probably won't.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>JIRA</b> - to keep track of all our tasks and assign priorities to them.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Sprints</b> - breaking down larger projects into smaller chunks of work means we can release more features more frequently.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Wallboards</b> - these tell us, at a glance, who’s working on what this week and whether any release deadlines are coming up.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Retrospectives</b> - we do a quick review at the end of each sprint or project and make any necessary adjustments for the next sprint.
