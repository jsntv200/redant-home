    One of the things we focus on is developing Digital Products. These
    are websites that provide some form of utility to users - these
    allow people to “do” stuff. Unlike a static site, which might be
    used for marketing a product or service, these sites
    <strong>are themselves the product or service</strong>.
  </p>
  <p class='mb-4'>
    A <strong>static site</strong> usually consists of a number of pages, which
    might have a CMS to allow you to edit content and make new pages. Each page
    is essentially static - each visitor gets the same content. Sure, there
    might be some
    <a class='text-red-50 hover:underline' href='/blog/how-we-do/multi-variate-AB-testing/'>multivariate testing</a>
    running over the top so some visitors get different messages, but the core
    experience is the same.
  </p>
  <p class='mb-4'>
    A <strong>Digital Product</strong> is different in a number of ways. First,
    they provide utility to the user - to store information, learn new things,
    or interact with others. Second, the pages tend to be fairly dynamic,
    customising the experience and content based on that user. To give an
    example:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Facebook</strong> all members log in and get the same page. But
      that page changes radically between members depending on who their friends
      are and what they’ve done.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>12WBT</strong> all members get delicious recipes. But the recipe I
      see as a female wanting to lose weight will be different to the one you
      might see as a male on a strength program. Your weekly nutrition and
      exercise plan is completely different, as is your shopping list, the
      videos you see, etc.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p class='mb-4'>
    A static site can be relatively straightforward to build, with a wide
    variety of tools available ranging from popular ones like Wordpress or
    Drupal, through to more enterprise options like Sitecore or Adobe CQ.
  </p>
  <p>
    Digital product development is generally more involved, due to higher
    technical complexity. The focus is more on the user experience and providing
    that utility. Technical problems like caching and site speed become trickier
    - speeding up a static site is generally pretty straightforward, but a page
    that is different for each user is an entirely different challenge.
