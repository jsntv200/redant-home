  content="We take a “mobile first” approach to projects. Mobile technology moves quickly
  and the number of different devices is growing. Users’ expectation of
  flawless, continuous service has never been higher.
  <br /><br />
  To deal with this, we have been developing a mobile testing framework that
  allows us to test our work across a number of different devices automatically.
  A fresh version of the site is published, and then each of the target devices
  runs through a series of end-to-end browser tests using virtual users.
  <br /><br />
  This testing framework allows us to quickly identify issues and manage an
  ever-growing list of supported devices."
