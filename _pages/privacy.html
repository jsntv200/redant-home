  Looking to better understand your organisationâ€™s privacy practices? Our online Privacy Maturity Assessment tool can help! This quick and easy tool allows you to gauge the maturity of your privacy ecosystem across four key areas:

<p class="subheading-small">
  <ol>
    <li><b>Personal Information</b> - how well do you collect, use, and manage personal information?</li>
    <li><b>Notification</b> - are you communicating effectively with individuals about their privacy rights and how their information is being used?</li>
    <li><b>Cross Border</b> - are you appropriately managing cross-border data flows and complying with relevant regulations?</li>
    <li><b>Security</b> - how effectively are you protecting personal information from unauthorised access, use, and disclosure?</li>
  </ol>
</p>
