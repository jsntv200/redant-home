  <p></p><p>We’ve worked on several eCommerce projects for our clients, all with varying requirements and issues to solve.</p>
  <ul>
  	<li><strong>Integrated eCommerce</strong> – for a site like 12WBT, the eCommerce is integrated closely with the membership process, rather than living in a separate shop area.</li>
	<li><strong>Segregated eCommerce</strong> – for other projects, like beautyheaven, the eCommerce elements need to have a separate shop area.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>In addition to selling stuff, a client’s eCommerce project might involve other things like coupons, a points/rewards system, or API integration. It’s important to weigh up the benefits of building something new versus adapting a SAAS system, so often we’ll review and explore existing options before deciding on an eCommerce strategy that targets your business needs.</p>
