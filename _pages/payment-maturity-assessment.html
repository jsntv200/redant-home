                    This quick online tool will help you understand the overall maturity of the payments ecosystem within your organisation.<br>
                    Different organisations have different strengths and levels of maturity. Understanding where your organisation sits can help you plan out next steps. We look at four key areas:<br>
                    <ol>
                      <li>Your current state - what you have in place at the moment</li>
                      <li>Your Team - what level of skill and training do the people driving payments have?</li>
                      <li>Management - how are decisions made and how does payments form part of management decisions</li>
                      <li>Technology - processes and culture for how your payment process is delivered</li>
                    </ol>
                  </p>
