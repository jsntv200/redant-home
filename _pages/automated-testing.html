    <p>When testing a web project, we check for four key things:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Does it work correctly?</li>
      <li>Does it look right?</li>
      <li>Is everything else still working?</li>
      <li>Are there any security holes?</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Each time a developer makes a change, it is sent to the lead developer for peer review. Once approved it is added to the code repository, which triggers a series of automated tests to check against all of the above criteria. By carefully describing how the site should function and then testing those functions, any issues are immediately picked up and resolved.</p><hr>
