Elasticsearch is a distributed, search and analytics engine that centrally stores your data so you can search, index, and analyze data of all shapes and sizes.  

You can go far beyond simple data retrieval and aggregate information to discover trends and patterns in your data. 

Red Ant has used Elasticsearch in many applications and can help identify how it can be used on both public and private applications.

* Elasticsearch also been proven to scale very reliably, which makes it a good solution for many larger data set projects.
* Scalability - it will work well with just a few nodes, but growing to a large cluster is almost entirely automatic
* Fast performance - by using distributed inverted indexes, elasticsearch is able to find best matches on full text searches even with very large data sets
* Elasticsearch uses JavaScript Object Notation, or JSON, as the serialisation format for documents. JSON serialisation is supported by various programming languages, and has become the standard format used by the NoSQL movement. It is simple, concise, and easy to read.
* Autocomplete and instance search allows efficient user experience
* Schema-less. Elasticsearch doesn’t require definitions for index, type or field type before indexing, which means any new object is automatically mapped even if it has a new property
* Near real time search -  you can search as quickly as a document can be indexed
