Swift is the established programming language to develop native applications for all of the Apple platforms: iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS. It was built using a modern approach to safety, performance, and software design patterns with the goal of making code easier to write and maintain.
Backed up with an excellent Software Development Kit and with a massive open-source community, it's become an extremely powerful language that is easy to integrate with other third party services. All this in part due to the loyal following the Apple brand has which provides any brand with massive exposure.
