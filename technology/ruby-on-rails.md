We started providing professional Ruby development services in 2005, so we’ve got some experience. Ruby is our core technology stack, and we’ve found it to be incredibly flexible and reliable. Technologies come and go, and it can be easy to get left behind. We’ve got some projects that are over 10y old that haven’t missed a beat.
Ruby allows a developer to quickly build out a prototype which can then be scaled up to Production level code. The framework structure encourages clear thinking and planning, and automated tests, security and privacy come by default.
Ruby on Rails is often used with other frameworks. A typical combination is to use Ruby for the backend and API, and build a web frontend in React. It really comes down to the kind of interface and interactions your project requires.
