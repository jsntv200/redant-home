Some of these elements are static while some pull in and present dynamic information. React is widely used because of its reliability and ability to fetch rapidly changing data. Our highly experienced front end team have created hundreds of successful user interfaces that result in a fast and seamless user experience.

React is a JavaScript framework maintained by Facebook that's ideal for building complex, modern user interfaces. React solves many of the problems that developers face when trying to build and maintain large, complex web applications. It’s an open source technology that is supported both by Facebook and a large open source community.
ReactJS allows a developer to create one set of code, and then deploy one version to the web, and ReactNative versions of the same code to Apple iOS and Android. This saves time and money initially, and also reduces the burden of having to maintain three separate code bases.
