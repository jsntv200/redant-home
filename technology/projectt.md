description: Red Ant is a leading, Australian based team of Ruby on Rails Developers. We’ve worked with hundreds of companies and startups to integrate their apps with Projectt.
listing_description: <a href="https://projectt.io">Projectt</a> is our Program Management tool that allows us to better understand how our Agile projects are tracking. We built Projectt for our own purposes to combine data from Harvest time tracking, Forecast and Jira issue tracking tools and provide a prediction on how it will land. It’s then easy to make tweaks to our project management to make sure we meet the needs of the project during the sprint. We invite our clients to join us by giving them a view of the tasks and time being invested on their sprint. In 2019 we commercialised <a href="https://projectt.io">Projectt</a> to help all Program Managers gain clarity on the health of their projects.
