  Just like checking your own health, it is useful to get your code reviewed and checked out by a different set of eyes. We can give you a better idea of the good and the bad, and help you understand technical debt.
  We'll perform an expert review of your code for security issues, performance problems and a quality analysis. You’ll get a good idea of how your code benchmarks against industry standards.

### Common questions people want answers to

* How good/reliable is the code we already have?
* Is it ready to go live?
* Have we made the right technology choice?
* What are my options from here?
* We keep on having this issue with X and Y. Are these resolved or do you think they’ll get worse?
* We have this code and our developer thinks it is fantastic, but it keeps on breaking. Why? Is it good or bad?
