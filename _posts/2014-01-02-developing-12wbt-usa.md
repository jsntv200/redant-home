From NYTimes article:

> In Australia, Ms. Bridges is best known for her role as the trainer on that countrys edition of the TV show The Biggest Loser. She has lines of housewares and workout clothes sold through discount department stores. She is also the personality behind 12WBT, an interactive online diet and fitness program in a country for which obesity rates have grown to 63 percent in recent years. Since 12WBT was introduced in January 2010 in Australia, more than 250,000 people have joined at $199 Australian ($176) or 12 weekly payments of $19.99. Now she's bringing 12WBT to the United States, along with the rest of her brand, in an attempt to gain a share of the lucrative diet industry. It remains to be seen, though, if theres room for another diet guru in a saturated field.
