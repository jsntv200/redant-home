**Volume**

Looking at all revenue in your organisation, what percentage of this is digital? Look at the value and volume to determine importance of digital payments.

| % of Value | % of Volume | How important? |
| ---------- | ----------- | -------------- |
| High | High | Very important - it’s the majority of your revenue |
| High | Low | Important, especially as the volume of digital transactions increases |
| Low | High | Important, especially as the value of digital transactions increases |
| Low | Low | Less important |

**Design**

What is the design of your payments process? Is it a “bolt on” experience, with some seemingly random payment gateway website that a customer suddenly lands on at the end of their order experience? Or is the flow of payments integrated into your customer experience, and it solves both customer and business needs?
There is no right or wrong answer with this. On one hand there is no point in reinventing the wheel, and developing custom code or processes for something you can simply buy as a module. No code to maintain, and less security footprint to worry about (kind of).

On the other hand, even though the bolt on approach was quick, it doesn’t necessarily that’s the best option for your business. A crap experience that loses you sales is still a crap solution - no matter how quick and cheap it was. Your customers don’t care. You may be able to use a seamless integration of a really clever payment flow to enhance your product and customer experience. Consider how Apple packages their products- they could have just used some bubble wrap and a box, but instead they carefully designed the unboxing experience.

**Security**

Security is the big ticket issue with payments. One way to test if there’s a security issue is when trying to answer the question of who wears the risk if something Really Bad happens. A mature organisation is aware and understands it in pragmatic, relative terms. One early sign of immaturity is when people tell you that there is no risk, or that somehow someone else will wear it. Or that a vendor is somehow going to take the fall if something goes wrong.

The follow up question is that if a problem did occur, who would be the first to pick it up - someone in the organisation or a customer?

**Context**

How well do people in your organisation understand needs around payment processes and customer data? At one end of the scale, the payment process and data handling might look very similar to what it was 10 or 20 years ago. People involved are set in their ways, or perhaps there are legacy systems That Can Never Be Changed.

At the other end is a more customer focussed approach, with needs and pain points identified and reflected in the design. Backed up by research and stakeholder input.

**Documentation**

How well are these processes documented? Are there clear responsibilities and processes set up? How comfortable is everyone about what should happen when? A team that relies on people to somehow do the right thing without a clear process to follow may run into problems at some point.

**Knowledge & Skills**

How well does the team understand the payment process? Is it widely understood, or the domain of a select few? Has this knowledge been recorded in some kind of central area, and does everyone have access to this information?

What about the skill level of the team when it comes to payments? Is there a program of ongoing training and learning?

**People**

How well does your payments team handle their responsibilities around data and the payment process? In some cases, we’ve seen this handled by one very capable person, while in other organisations it’s a much bigger team. How good are they at changing best practices into habits for the entire team?

What about HR? Is this responsibility area formally defined and recognised? Or is it more like one of those unsaid things some people “just do as part of their job”? We’ve found that unless this is clearly defined and rewarded, it can be hard to progress the efficiency or improve areas like security.

**Ownership & Responsibilities**

So one big question - is there an owner of the payments process? The quick answer to this is often whoever is the top executive or owner of the business. Because it sounds like “owning the payments process” might involve lots of money and possibly bouncing on a bed covered with hundred dollar bills. Or something along those lines.

The owner of the payments process is responsible for a strategic plan. They understand the problems and opportunities, and develop a road map and KPIs. They are a key decision maker, but also need to consult widely with stakeholders. And no bouncing on beds.

They also need to have enough authority to make decisions and effect change. An immature organisation may well have an owner, but they are either disengaged or lacking the authority or resources to make the change.

**Metrics & Payment KPIs**

Most organisations have some kind of simple metric for payments - such as the cash flow for this week. More mature payment processes break this down in to a lot more detail, along with tracking the results against expected values (KPIs).

But to start at the beginning, the first step is to set up some kind of monitoring, so you can start to measure different metrics. Ideally this is log based rather than just current - that way you can understand the current state but also see context (is this above or below the average or trend?). As your process matures, you can start to track leading indicators which then result in a payment metric.

An example of your payment metric might be percent of successful transactions. But before that might be incoming traffic to your site. And before that might be google searches on specific terms. Each of these also has a negative result - for example how much traffic wasn’t coming to your site? Of the traffic that did arrive, how many of those people never got to payment? And of the payments, how many were unsuccessful?

Once you have metrics, it’s also a really good idea to make these both accessible and able to be queried. So if one of your board members wants to compare results of a metric for this month and the same period last year, it should be quick and easy.

Finally, mature organisations also have processes in place that allow them to quickly respond to metrics. This tends to make them more proactive (before the trend becomes a problem) rather than reactive (lots of customers complaining). They execute work with the clear objective of improving specific metrics, and the results can be measured.
