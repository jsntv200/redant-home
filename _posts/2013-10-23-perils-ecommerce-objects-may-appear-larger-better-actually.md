How I ended up here:

* I go to a shopping mall, try to buy shoes for my 9yo son
* First try discount store which shall remain nameless, because you'll think I'm cheap. Nothing even remotely child sized - every shoe is gigantum size or pink
* Try a specialty kids shoe shop, walk out amazed at the queues. Why do parents do this to themselves?
* Think I'm being clever, catch a movie and then try again a few hours later. The queues are even bigger.
* Go home, check shoe size (5) and then jump online. Grab child to confirm style and colour.
* Shoes are ordered, feeling smug. I'm the Cool Dad. Yeah.
* My wife comes home and points out that for children's shoes there is toddler size (up to size 12) and then it starts again with "youth" size 1
* I check eBay, and yes the description is pretty clear (if I had scrolled down to read that far) that this is in fact a 6cm shoe
* [Dreaded delivery](http://www.benchfly.com/blog/caution-objects-may-appear-larger-than-they-really-are/) arrives. Luckily there has been a rush on babies at Red Ant recently (something in the coffee I think), so there are plenty of little feet.
