## Huggies Baby Name Finder

[![Baby Name finder](/assets/uploads/2008/bnf.jpg)](http://huggies.com.au/babynames/)

The Baby Name finder is an AJAX tool that helps you look up baby names, as well as create a list of favourites to share. We referenced these names against names that members had already chosen for their children - so if you're thinking about Joshua, we can show you the ten most popular sibling names from families that already have a Joshua.
